from the original data set at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

we have 


- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.


### We merge test/y_test.txt and train/y_train.txt in one column 10297 lines of names subjects

### We merge test/y_test.txt and train/y_train.txt in one column 10297 lines of name activities


### We merge test/x_test.txt and train/x_train.txt in 561 column 10297 lines of name 1 to 561, 1 per activity 1...

### we merge this 3 data sets in one 10297 obs of 563 variables



### merge features
#### name column activities
#### merge features X_test and X_train
#### selection feature mean and sd

### merge all data

## From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
